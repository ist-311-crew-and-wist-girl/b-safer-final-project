# Installation Instructions

Hello there Professor, thanks for checking out our final project submission! Luckily for you,
the installation of the project is very easy! All you need to do is download the following JDK
and set it up as the project's SDK:

* [JDK 1.8 Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/)

The JDK comes with JavaFX out of the box, so you should not need to do
any further configuration in order to launch our application!

# User login information

Our application has 5 users. You can use any of the following username and password combinations
in order to log in:

* conner-s, password
* jason-n, pass
* damian-p, hello
* varalika-a, bro
* hunter-d, theguy

# Notes

All the necessary data and files are here in order for the application to run correctly, but
you might need to adjust the file paths if you are running on OSX, Linux, or any other
UNIX-like variant. All our developers were running off of Windows, so our file paths
use "\" instead of "/". If this is a huge issue getting the application running,
please contact jcn23@psu.edu for assistance with getting it working on another operating system.

All images and icons should load in once the program execution begins.
